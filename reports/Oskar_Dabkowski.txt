\f0\fs26 \cf0 This week was mainly organizational for me. At first we had one idea or organising the project. I was responsible for putting schedule on trello with division of tasks between groups of 2-3 people each.  As I arrived on a TD, we (me, Pablo and Ruben) couldn't write code because of the fact that our part had many clashes with other parts of the project concerning couple of other groups. After a meeting the organisation was changed and I became a part of a group responsible for class of living beings in general.\
During the weekend we had a meeting within a group, where we decided and discussed structure of our part of a project. We decided that me and Flavia during next week will be responsible for decisions on living being's actions after work done by neural network.}
