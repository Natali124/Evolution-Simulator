Week 2:
	This week I implemented a prototype for the Window that will visualise our evolution sim with some placeholder classes. While experimenting with the different objects in QTgraphics, I had an idea for an inheritance structure for our classes and pitched it to the team.
	Next week I plan to further polish and improve the game visualiser window and maybe work on updating our existing classes so that they fit with the respective window.
