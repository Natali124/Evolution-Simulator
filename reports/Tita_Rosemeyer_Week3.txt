This week I worked on the following:
- changed constructors in Layer, Neuron, Network to work with new keyword
- added Destructors to Layer, Neuron, Network
- tested Layer class functions
- updated UML diagram of Layer, Neuron, Network and Edge

Next week I plan to work on the following:
- fix errors in randomize_edges() function of neural network
- test network::propagate() 
- review memory usage, maybe change destructors to free more memory
