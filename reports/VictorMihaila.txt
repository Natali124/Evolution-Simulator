Week 2:
This week I researched the different elements necessary for building a C++ GUI and I implemented menu with a toolbar and some buttons for simple tasks such as closing a window or displaying a message to get familiar with these elements.
Next week I plan to start working on the GUI of the project.   

Week 3:
This week I implemented some preliminary designs for plants and predators. Next week I plan on further working on these designs, as well as one for preys. 

Week 4:
This week I fixed some bugs with the designs of the creatures and then integrated them in the classes Plant and Creature. I also wrote a possible way of randomizing the creatures spawned on the grid.
Next week I hope to work on displaying different actions of the creatures.

Week 5:
This week I studied the QPixmap so that I will be able to replace the current designs for living beings I drew previously with better designs displayed as images.
Next week I plan on creating these designs in some other way that I am yet to figure out and the implement them in the simulation.
