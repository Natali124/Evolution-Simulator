This week I worked on the following:
- Implemented an evolution focused on just the neural network to test functionality for a given "goal-function"
	-> copied Network::reproduce() from reproduction team
	-> implemented loss functions to calculate loss between given and expected output vector
	-> implemented do_step function that 
		-> evaluates networks on random input vectors
		-> deletes the worst performing networks
		-> reproduces remaining networks 
		-> calculates average loss
	-> implemented run_evolution that runs for some generations and prints average losses (with variable parameters)
- tested the evolution and varied parameters to find "sweet spot"
- Debugged and finished the Network-to-file and file-to-network functions with Anja Matic (which took quite a long time and is not done yet)

Next week I plan to work on the following:
- Resolve the last few build errors still present 
- work on presentation of the network (maybe using QuickCanava? -> need to install and read documentation)
