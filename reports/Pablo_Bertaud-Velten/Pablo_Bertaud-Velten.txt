\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 3:\
\
This week I worked on the digest function, which is what happens when a creature eats another creature or a plant. For this to be properly imbedded in the rest of the actions, I had to create a digest_step function, which would update the creature's stats in function of what it ate, and so this required the creation of other data attributes for creatures, such as digest_time and foot_attributes. Then I also worked on minor changes like reorganizing a few things and making the is_eaten function for plants, using what Garance had previously done, by improving the structure and making it more condensed.\
\
Next week my goal will be to find some new features to implement, in order to broaden the simulation and make it more interesting


Week 4: \
This week I created a bew branch called Frontend_Statistics to work on the stats part of the simulation. I defined the main window, and thought about which variables to measure and what stats to implement.\



Week 5:\

This week I worked on the Statistics part of the project, implementing counters for different types of species, as well as a counter for steps in the simulation. I am also currently trying to implement the advance() function to update the charts when the environment changes (birht, death, etc). I also implemented a common die() member function for animals and plants, simplifying the code a bit. The goal now is to manage to solve all the issues associated to the stats window and the link it makes with the rest of the simulation.


Week 6:
This week I worked some more on the Statistics part, by implementing a function which counts the living beings, creatures and plants. I also merged the branch Temp_Living_Being into the branch Living_Being_Oriented to simplify the actions of the teams, as this was causing various subgroups to be working simultaneously on different versions of the project although with a common goal in mind. I also created new dedicated files for the statistics part of the project, in order to make things more compartimentalized and clear.
