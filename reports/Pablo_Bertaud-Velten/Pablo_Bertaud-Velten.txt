\f0\fs26 \cf0 Week 3:\
\
This week I worked on the digest function, which is what happens when a creature eats another creature or a plant. For this to be properly imbedded in the rest of the actions, I had to create a digest_step function, which would update the creature's stats in function of what it ate, and so this required the creation of other data attributes for creatures, such as digest_time and foot_attributes. Then I also worked on minor changes like reorganizing a few things and making the is_eaten function for plants, using what Garance had previously done, by improving the structure and making it more condensed.\
\
Next week my goal will be to find some new features to implement, in order to broaden the simulation and make it more interesting}
