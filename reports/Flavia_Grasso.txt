\f0\fs26 \cf0 This week, Garance and I started implementing the several classes we needed for the Backend team. We worked in particular on the living being and the inherited classes (creatures and plant). Howerver, we did some reorganization of the project teams and we will work along with Ruben Pablo and Oscar on the living beings characteristics and behaviors.\
For next week, Oscar and I will start looking at the \'93decision\'94 part of the living beings. We will work with the Neural Network\'92s output and help the living being take a decision (sleeping, eating, attacking or moving) based on some conditions we will decide on.}

Week 2
This week I worked on the implementation of the decision function, that given an input vector of parameters, runs a decision of either eat, move, sleep or attack. I also implemented the eat and find_food functions while other members of the subteam did the three remaining. 

Week 3
After finalizing the attack function with oscar I did some research on the functioning of QGraphicsItem Class that I will pursue next week, to fix any bugs we may have with visualizing the living beings and implement the move_away function with Oscar. 


Week 4
This week I mostly conducted some reaserch on using QGraphicsItem to help  implement the move_away() function and did some changes for the get_close() function. Since our group finished most of the tasks and we need to wait for the output of the neural network to see the result (or not) of our code. I will see next week what my next task is depending on the results.

Week 5
Unfortunately, the results for the evolution didn't turn out to be exactly what we wanted, there was some debugging we needed to do. I did some small changes to a couple of functions. One of the things we saw from the evolution is that some creatures spawned and had very low HP but continued to live. So Ruben had to change the die function and asked me to implement a counter_attack() and last_attack() function, that would give a parameter to the NN depending on when the last attack was, that would alter its behavior (if a creature was attacked recently it should be weaker).
Next week, Vincenzo asked me to do some work with the Barrier branch. I will make so that the creatures die if they go towards the barrier.

Week 6: This week I worked on the barrier branch so that whenever a creature touched the barrier it would die. I also worked on the symmetry of the screen, such as the pacman game: when one creature exits by one side, it comes back to the other one. 
Since most of the work includes debugging and ensuring that evolution works correctly, I will be working on the graphs part for the next week, which will be the key instrument to understand the evolution. 

Week 7: This week I worked on the charts part as I mentioned last week. I first helped Garance and Pablo fix an error that occured in one of their graphs. Then, I wanted to implement a new line graph that displayed the average size of every creature as a function of time. Once the graph showed with no problem, we thought it would be interesting to observe the different behaviours of the preys and of the predators. Indeed, overall the predators end up evolving into bigger creatures, whereas the preys, to escape the predators would become smaller.
