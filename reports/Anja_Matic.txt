Week 1

This week I worked on implementation of the neutron class, creating the constructors, and methods, except for the method forward_propagate. Moreover, in the class layer I implemented the []-operator, along with the function add_neuron and in the class edge I added the attribute is_active and functions to a access it and set it. Next week I plan to continue working on the neural network

Week 2

This week I implemented an enumerate variable for the activatoin function in the networks class and changed the attributes taht were before objects to pointers in the classes layer and network. Next week I plan to work on testing the neural network.
