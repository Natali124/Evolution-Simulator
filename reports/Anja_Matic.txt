Week 1

This week I worked on implementation of the neutron class, creating the constructors, and methods, except for the method forward_propagate. Moreover, in 
the class layer I implemented the []-operator, along with the function add_neuron and in the class edge I added the attribute is_active and functions to a 
access it and set it. Next week I plan to continue working on the neural network

Week 2

This week I implemented an enumerate variable for the activation function in the networks class and changed the attributes that were before objects to 
pointers in the classes layer and network. Next week I plan to work on testing the neural network.

Week 3

This week I implemented two different functions to represent for string representation of the neural network. I also implemented the function remove_edge 
and fixed the implementation of add_layer. Next week I plan to work on testing and improving the neural network.

Week 4

This week I created an outline for the functions used to save the network in a file and from such a file reconstruct the network. 
To this end, I researched file handling in C++ and wrote an outline on Trello how this function could be implemented. I also implmented the function
network_to_file, with the helper functions network_to_vector, layer_to_vector and vector_to_file. Next week I plan to either implement more functonlities
for the neural network or work on other parts of the project, depending on what is needed.

Week 5

This week I finished the function for reading and constructing the network that I had outlined the previous week. To this end I read up on reading files in 
C++ and string methods. Moreover, I implemented the functions file_to_vector, vector_to_layer, vector_to_network and file_to_network. Tita helped me with
debugging the functions. Nxt week, I plan to either join the teams working or statistics or work on displaying the network.


Week 6
This week I worked on representing the Neural Network as a graph. After discussing with the other memebers of the Neural Network, we decided to use pyhton
for drawing the graphs. I modified the saving function, so that it also saved the values of each node and the reading function so that it accounted for 
change in the incomming file. Moreover, I implemented the reading, conctructing and drawing functions in python. Next week I will keeep working on the
implementation of the drawing, for example, colouring the edges according to activation, and integrating the python script with the rest of the project.
