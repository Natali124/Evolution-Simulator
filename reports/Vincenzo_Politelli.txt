\f0\fs24 \cf0 Week 2:\
Coded data attributes of the classes using the std library. Research on frontend (how to implement graphics).\
Next week I will dedicate my time to implement better and more realistic graphics.\
\
Week 3:\
Organised the visualisation of the creature in order to proceed with the simulation.\
Coded the class Barrier.\
Next week I will take care of real time drawing in Qt.\
Week 4:\
Taken care of merging the branches to the main.\
Redefined the play_step() function to have a working simulation.\
Implemented real-time drawing of barriers.\
Next week I will improve the realtime drawing of the barrier in order to have more fluid graphics.\
Week 4:\
Make beings movable (drag them around the screen).\
Improve the drawing of the barrier.\
Next week I will take care of events like drawing barrier on creatures.\
Week 5:\
Make movable and drawing barrier at the same time.\
Coded a functionality that allows to kill creatures by touching them.\
Merging several branches into main to conclude the project.\
Next week I will try to implement a startscreen.\
Week 6:\
Devise a new system to make creatures move,\
in order to speed up the learning process and simplify the simulation.\
Next week I will perfection this system and conclude the project.\
Week 7:\
Experimented with the decision-making process in the branches spanning_living_being and easy_living_being.\}
