Next week I\'92ll dedicate my time to implement better and more realistic graphics.\
\
Week 3:\
Organised the visualisation of the creature in order to proceed with the simulation.\
Coded the class Barrier.\
Next week I will take care of real time drawing in Qt.
Week 4:\
Taken care of merging the branches to the main.\
Redefined the play_step() function to have a working simulation.\
Implemented real-time drawing of barriers.\
Next week I will improve the realtime drawing of the barrier in order to have more fluid graphics.\
Week 4:\
Make beings movable.\
Improve the drawing of the barrier.\
Next week I'll take care of events like drawing barrier on creatures.\}
