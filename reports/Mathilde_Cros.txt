\f0\fs26 \cf0 This week I made some research on the different widgets on Qt that allowed me to design sliders for the frontend, such as QSlider, QDial and QScrollBar (to adapt the view for the multiple sliders and buttons we will enventually code) which inherit their functionalities from QAbstractSlider. I also had a look at the widget QProgressBar and how to link its value with QSlider, as well as at the possible styles and layouts you can give to a Qt Widget. I had never used or seen any Qt Graphics functionality before. I started working late to get informed about Qt Slider Widgets because I joined the Frontend team on thursday evening only, as there were complications in the backend, and people needed in the frontend.\
Next week I will start coding and trying to implement these different sliders in the frontend branch.}
