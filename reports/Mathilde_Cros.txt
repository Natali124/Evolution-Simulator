Week 1
This week I made some research on the different widgets on Qt that allowed me to design sliders for the frontend, such as QSlider, QDial and QScrollBar (to adapt the view for the multiple sliders and buttons we will enventually code) which inherit their functionalities from QAbstractSlider. I also had a look at the widget QProgressBar and how to link its value with QSlider, as well as at the possible styles and layouts you can give to a Qt Widget. I had never used or seen any Qt Graphics functionality before. I started working late to get informed about Qt Slider Widgets because I joined the Frontend team on thursday evening only, as there were complications in the backend, and people needed in the frontend.\
Next week I will start coding and trying to implement these different sliders in the frontend branch.}

Week 2
This week, I first gathered all the properties the Back-end is taking care of giving our creatures in order to know what "initial" buttons we want to use as inputs for our creatures properties. I then experimented coding to link QSliders and QProgressBars, but also checkboxes for random inputs and draging in different layouts in mainwindow.ui. I created a side branch (Slider_Prop) to experiment on before doing any commits to the project.
Next week, I will make sure my files are correct to make commits / merge my side branch to the frontend one, and test the functionalities, adjust them. I will differentiate case for predatures, preys, plants, and maybe implement proportional input values for the different properties (like if you are very big, then you can't move very fast).

Week 3
This week, I merged (manually, as I had to make slight modifications of my code's emplacements) the work I did on Slider prop branch to the Frontend Start Screen branch, and I coded a randomizing button that gives out random values for all the different properties, with the widgets (spinbox and slider) linked together. I ended up not implementing proportional input values as when meeting with the group on manday, we judged it would be more interesting to have to possibility for the creatures to evolve into "invicible creatures" eventually.
Next week, I will connect this layout to the list (predator 1, predator 2, predator 3 etc. (or prey or plant)), so I will have to fiinish differentiating the cases for the creatures and find a way to link the list so that we can choose the properties for each creature separately.
