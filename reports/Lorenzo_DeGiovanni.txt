Week 1
After researching how to create clickable buttons.
Me and Arjun were able to create a start button which disappears once clicked which leads to a screen with an additional three buttons, each next to a slider.
These buttons represent the ability to add an extra plant, predator or prey into the simulation.
The sliders enable the user to select the quantity of each variable that they want to implement.
We also were able to understand how to implement a background picture, by attaching it to a widget.
However, we still have not understood how to layer said picture, hence this is what I will be focusing on next week, as well as connecting the slider to the buttons.

Week 2 
We redesigned the layout of the buttons page, connecting the counters with the buttons
and now when selecting the amount of predators, preys or plants to add into the simulation it opens a widget with the ability to scroll for each added variable
