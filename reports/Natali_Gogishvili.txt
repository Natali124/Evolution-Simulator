Week 1:

Worked on Edge class in neural networks, fixed issue with #include directives in files of neural networks folder, wrote f_activation function in layer, propagate function in neuron, propagate function in network. Worked on cleaning up github repository.
Next week, I am going to work more on neural network class and write test cases for testing neural network functions.

Week 2:

Worked on Network class. Added/implemented functions, getters, setters, default constructor with randimized edges. Was trying to develop tests but had problems with it, will try again next week during the TD. I am not exactly sure what I will be working on next week as neural networks are done. I will either be helping out to other groups, start a new part, or work on packpropagation of neural networks.

Week 3:

Set up main function/cpp.main file in neural networks branch for testing neural networks. Worked on testing Edge class, identified errors in networks/layers classes.
