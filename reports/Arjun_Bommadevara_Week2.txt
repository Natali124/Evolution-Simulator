This week, me and Lorenzo worked on familiarizing ourselves with QT GUI that we will use to develop the frontend of the project.
We worked on understanding the class QPushButton that will be used for making the initial start button, as well as buttons that add plants, 
predators and prey to the environment. We implemented a simple, large start button that, when clicked, dissapears and makes 3 buttons (for 
adding predators, prey and plants) appear on the window, as well as counters that appear next to them (To allow user to decide number of predators,
prey or plants to add). We added a background by adding an image to a widget dedicated to being a background.
Next week, I will be focusing on layering the widgets, such that the background appears behind all other widgets, as well as connecting counter to 
buttons.
